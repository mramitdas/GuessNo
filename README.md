# Number Guessing

A fun project to guess the number after getting a few hints from the computer. Every time a user gives a wrong answer, another hint pops up to make it easier for them.

- steps:
  - The user enters the lower and upper bounds of the range.
  - As a result, the compiler generates a random integer between the range and stores it in a variable for future use.
  - A while loop will be created for repetitive guessing.
  - When a user guesses a number that is greater than a randomly selected number, the user receives the message “Try Again!”. Your guess was too high.
  - If the user guesses a number smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output of “Try Again!”.Your guess was too small”
  - In addition, if the user guesses within a minimum number of attempts, they get a “Congratulations!” message.
  - If the user fails to guess the integer in the minimum number of guesses, he/she will receive a “Better Luck Next Time!
